# LatencySim

A **stupid simple latency simulator** in JavaScript.  

Ever wondered if 100ms of input delay is really *that bad*? Well, now you can find out. This little project mocks up a game menu and slaps an **artificial flat delay** on your input. Use the arrow keys to navigate and enjoy the frustration.

## Features (if you can call them that)

- **Adjustable latency**: Goes from 0ms to 2000ms in increments of 50ms.  
- **No-frills menu simulation**: It's literally just a fake game menu. Don't expect anything groundbreaking.  
- **Test your patience**: Because waiting a second for your input to register is way more fun than you'd think.

## How to Use

1. **Boot it up**: Just open the HTML file in your browser. That's it. No setup, no dependencies, no nonsense.  
2. **Arrow keys**: Use them to navigate the fake menu.  
3. **Mess with the latency**: Adjust the delay and see how much you can tolerate before losing your mind.

## Why does this exist?

Honestly? I don't know. Maybe you're curious about how input latency feels. Maybe you're procrastinating. Or maybe you're just a masochist. Either way, here it is.
